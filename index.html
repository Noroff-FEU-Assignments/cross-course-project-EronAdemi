         Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater 
         than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The first thing the client should do is set up https certificates on 
        the servers so that the data information is encrypted while transferring. 
        Firewall rules and open ports should always be double checked. Important codes should render out from server 
        side and not client side to 
        prevent SQL injections or XSS ( Cross site scripting ). Using authentication headers. Validating sessions frequently. ]</p>
